# Rediscovering C

## Introduction

"Rediscovering C" is a personal exploration project that provides insight into the world of C programming, particularly as it pertains to application development. This project, spearheaded by an experienced software engineer who's spent much of their career working with high-level languages like Javascript and Python, aims to revisit the foundations of C.

C has been the bedrock of computer science and serves as the underpinning of many modern systems, including heavy industry machinery. This project is an opportunity to delve into low-level development and gain an understanding of computer systems' architecture in heavy industry.

## Project Overview

The main project within this repository is a simple "todo list" application. Though it may seem mundane, this app serves as a template for experimenting with and understanding the intricacies of C programming.

### Features

- Add tasks to the todo list
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- View all tasks
- Delete tasks

## Disclaimer

It is important to note that this project is not intended to be a benchmark for writing ideal C code. Rather, it's a window into my exploration of using C for application development, offering both successes and failures as learning opportunities. The code may contain unconventional practices and mistakes, but they are part of the learning process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC or another compatible C compiler
- Basic knowledge of C programming

### Compilation and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the source code using `gcc -o todo_app main.c`
4. Run the program with `./todo_app`

## Contribution

Though this is a personal project, I'm open to collaboration and feedback. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have suggestions or improvements.

## Conclusion

"Rediscovering C" is more than a simple todo list app; it's a journey back to the roots of programming. Whether you're a student trying to grasp the basics or an experienced programmer looking to revisit an old friend, this repository is a treasure trove of learning and exploration. Enjoy the journey!
